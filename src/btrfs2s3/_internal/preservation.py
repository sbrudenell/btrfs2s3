"""Code related to schedule-based preservation of snapshots of data.

The design of btrfs2s3's preservation schedule is based on the "retention
policies" of
btrbk. See https://digint.ch/btrbk/doc/btrbk.conf.5.html#_retention_policy for
details.

Broadly, we define a set of time spans, and for each one we preserve the first
snapshot that was created in that time span.

The first snapshot of a year is considered the yearly snapshot. The first
snapshot of a month is the monthly snapshot. We say that a
snapshot is "nominal" for the year and/or month, respectively.

btrfs2s3 supports preserving yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly,
daily, hourly, "minutely" and "secondly" snapshots.

btrfs2s3 only supports time spans (years, months, days, etc) that are
"grid-aligned". That is, days last from midnight to midnight, never from noon
to noon.

In btrfs2s3, the preservation schedule is significant when choosing parents
for incremental backups. If a policy keeps one monthly and one yearly
backup, then we will store the yearly backup as a full backup. We will store the
monthly backup as an incremental
backup, having the yearly full backup as the parent.

The time zone is significant when defining a preservation schedule (for example,
"midnight" corresponds to a different unix timestamp depending on the time
zone). A change to the time zone of a preservation schedule can completely change
the nominality of snapshots, which could lead to undesired deletion of data,
longer-than-expected incremental backup chains, or heavily-duplicated full
backups.

To avoid this chaos, we never honor the system locales or time zones. We require
time  zones to be explicitly specified, defaulting to UTC.

By convention, time spans are represented as
tuples of left-closed right-open intervals (that is, the same convention used by
python slices). For example, the year 2006 in UTC is represented as (1136073600.0,
1167609600.0), even though it does NOT include the upper boundary timestamp of
1167609600.0.

        snapshot should be retained.

        Note that this only yields time spans which overlap the argument

        btrfs2s3 (in resolver.py) will store backups as full or incremental
        based primarily on this function. If a backup is nominal for the FIRST

        returned by this function for which the backup in question is NOT
        nominal. For example, if a Policy calls for yearly and monthly
        backups, then the yearly backups will be full backups (because the
